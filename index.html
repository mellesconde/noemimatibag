I don't see what I have to offer.
I should've been a season.
Guess you could see I had potential.
Do you know you're my miracle?

I'm like a statue
Stuck staring right at you.
Got me frozen in my tracks.
So amazed how you take me back
Each and every time our love collapsed.

(Stuck like a statue)
Don't wanna lose you. No.
(Stuck like a statue)

Ask myself why are you even with me
After all the shit I put you through?
Why did you make it hard so with me?
It's like you're living in an igloo.

But baby your love is so warm it makes my shield melt down, down.
And every time we're both at war you make me come around.

What is the reason when you really could've any man you want?
I don't see what I have to offer.
I should've been a season.
Guess you could see I had potential.
Do you know you're my miracle?

I'm like a statue
Stuck staring right at you.
Got me frozen in my tracks.
So amazed how you take me back
Each and every time our love collapsed.

Statue
Stuck staring right at you.
So when I'm lost for words
Every time I disappoint you,
It's just 'cause I can't believe
That you're so beautiful.
(Stuck like a statue)
Don't wanna lose you. No.
(Stuck like a statue)
And you're so beautiful.
(Stuck like a statue)
Don't wanna lose you. Never.
(Stuck like a statue)
Oh, no.

Every single day of my life I thank my lucky stars.
God really had to spend extra time when he sculpted your heart.
'Cause there's no explanation.
Can't solve the equation.
It's like you love me more than I love myself.

I'm like a statue

Stuck like a statue.

Don't wanna lose you, no.
(The reason for breathing)
Stuck like a statue.
(You're so beautiful)
When a day is said and done,
In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love.
Stay awake looking at your beauty,
Telling myself I'm the luckiest man alive.

'Cause so many times I was certain
You was gonna walk out of my life, life.
Why you take such a hold of me, girl,
When I'm still trying to get my act right?
